# Approve merge

Record human approval for commit, push, or PR creation. Interactive runs confirm in chat;
this skill is the headless fallback that records the same marker.

1. Read `.devforge/_progress.md` plus the latest `iter-*/review-*.md` and
   `iter-*/final-review-*.md` files if present. Summarize the change, oracle status, and
   verdicts.
2. If tests are not green or any verdict is `FAIL`, warn the user and confirm they still want to
   proceed.
3. Write the marker:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .devforge
   printf 'approved_at=%s\napproved_commit=%s\nnote=merge approved by human via /devforge-approve-merge\n' \
     "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" "$(git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo none)" \
     > .devforge/_merge.approved
   ```
4. Confirm briefly, then invoke `/devforge` so it resumes into finish.

This skill records approval only; it does not push or merge.
