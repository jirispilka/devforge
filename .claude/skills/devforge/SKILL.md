# devforge

You are the orchestrator. Keep run data in `.devforge/`; `.claude/skills/` is tooling.

**The orchestrator routes; subagents judge; files are the only handoff.** The orchestrator never
writes a judgment file (`_request_fact_check.md`, `2-design.md`, `3-success-criteria.md`, review
or fulfillment files) — it writes only routing state (`1-triage.md`, `_design_feedback.md`,
`_panel.json`, `_state.json`, `_progress.md`).

There are exactly two human stops: the **design gate** before any source edit, and a
**create-PR confirm** before any git write. Each is a human approval the orchestrator never grants
itself. Triage has no gate — it flows onward unless it says DEFER/DECLINE. The loop:

`_user_request` → `1-triage` → `verify` → `[explore]` → `architect` → `success-criteria` →
`iterate with human` → `[_design.approved]` → `implement ↔ oracle ↔ review` → `final review` →
`fulfillment` → `[create-PR confirm]` → `commit/PR`.

## Files

Numbered files are human-facing; underscore-prefixed files are internal routing state. Chat is
ephemeral; the files are the record.

- Human-facing: `1-triage.md`, `2-design.md`, `3-success-criteria.md`.
- Internal: `_user_request.md`, `_request_fact_check.md`, `_codebase_map.md` (optional),
  `_design_feedback.md`, `_panel.json`, `_state.json`, `_progress.md`, `_design.approved`,
  `_create_pr.approved`.
- Per iteration in `iter-N/`: `claim.md`, `review-<use>.md`, `final-review-<use>.md`,
  `fulfillment.md`, and the regenerable (gitignored) `diff.patch`, `test-results.txt`.

**Why one file per stage:** each stage writes one file and each role reads ONLY what it needs, so
stage context stays scoped and judgments stay independent. Reviewers judge the diff against
`2-design.md` + `3-success-criteria.md`, never `claim.md` or peer reviews — paste the allowed
file contents into each reviewer's prompt instead of granting file access. The architect never
sees the success criteria; the criteria author never sees the proposed solution. That blindness
is what keeps every panel's signal independent.

## Keep the human in the loop (non-terminal sessions)

A web/mobile/remote human sees only the chat stream — they cannot open `.devforge/` files or
reliably type a slash-command. Surface everything they need into the conversation:

- **Show the FULL `2-design.md` and `3-success-criteria.md`** whenever you present or update
  them — paste the complete content, or render as an Artifact / send as a file. Never summarise
  them away or point at an on-disk path as the only way to see them.
- **Keep a visible progress view.** Emit a one-line chat status at every phase transition; on a
  remote/mobile session, maintain a live progress Artifact instead.
- **Gates are chat-first**; slash-commands are a fallback, not the only door.

## Setup / resume

1. `mkdir -p .devforge`. If `.devforge/.gitignore` is missing, write it: ignore `*` except
   `.gitignore`, `config.json`, `registry.json`.
2. Fresh run: require a non-empty `<task>`. Write it verbatim to `.devforge/_user_request.md`.
   Initialize `_state.json`: `{"phase":"triage","iteration":0,"head_sha":"<git rev-parse HEAD>"}`.
3. If `.devforge/_state.json` exists, resume. If a new non-empty `<task>` differs from
   `_user_request.md`, ask continue vs fresh; on fresh, move the old run into
   `.devforge/archive/<timestamp>/` first.
4. Load config before dispatching any stage:
   - Copy this skill's `config.default.json` to `.devforge/config.json` if absent.
   - Shallow-merge `.devforge/config.local.json` over it if present.
   - Resolve `registry.base.json` plus optional `.devforge/registry.json` `uses`.
   - Validate every configured `use` against `registry.stage_roles` and `registry.uses`; no
     duplicate `use` inside `reviewers` or `final_reviewers`. Single stages (`verify`,
     `architect`, `implementer`, `success_criteria`, `fulfillment`) may be absent from config.
   - Record `oracle.commands`, limits, plan-mode setting, and the fully-resolved registry in
     `_progress.md`.

Valid `state.phase` values: `triage`, `verify`, `design`, `design-gate`, `inner-loop`,
`final-review`, `review-run`, `create-pr`, `done`.

Resume by phase:
- `phase=triage`, `verify`, or `design` → continue that phase from its files.
- `phase=design-gate` + `_design.approved` → if HEAD differs from the marker's
  `approved_commit`, stop and re-confirm the design with the human first. Otherwise load
  `_panel.json` into `state.panel`, set `state.iteration=1`, and set `state.phase="inner-loop"`
  — or `"review-run"` when `state.review_only` is true.
- `phase=design-gate` without the marker → re-present the design + panel (step 4) and wait.
- `phase=inner-loop`, `final-review`, or `review-run` → continue that phase.
- `phase=create-pr` + `_create_pr.approved` → go to step 9.
- `phase=done` → the run is complete; report and stop.
- Otherwise, re-announce the stop being waited on and stop.

## Stage dispatch

Stages come from the validated config; there is no separate wrapper skill per engine. Only
triage and the iterate conversation run in the orchestrator itself. A single stage may be
configured model-only (`{"model": ...}` with no `use`): it runs the built-in role with the
Method line omitted. For stage key `K` with assignment `S`:

1. If `S.use` is set, resolve `role = registry.stage_roles[K]`, `engine =
   registry.uses[S.use].engine`, and `scope = registry.uses[S.use].scope`. With no `use`, use
   the built-in `role = registry.stage_roles[K]` and omit the Method line.
2. Resolve the model `M`: prefer the concrete pick recorded in `_panel.json` for this stage; else
   if `S.model` is `"auto"` or absent, pick from **Model tiering** below by role and triage tier;
   else use `S.model` verbatim.
3. Dispatch a subagent on model `M` with this whole instruction:

> You are filling devforge's **{role}** stage. You run non-interactively: you cannot ask the
> human anything — record open questions in your output file instead. Communicate only through
> `.devforge/` files. **Read:** {role.reads}. **Do NOT read:** {role.blind}. **Method:** follow
> `{engine}` — scoped as: {scope}. **Write:** `{role.writes}` in this format: {role.format}.

| role | reads | do NOT read | writes | format |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
| `verify` | `_user_request.md`, `1-triage.md`, codebase, referenced issue; **for a review-only run also the PR/branch description and its diff — treat that description as the claim source** | `2-design.md`, `3-success-criteria.md` | `_request_fact_check.md` | claim ledger: every request claim tagged `VALID \| STALE \| LIKELY-FIXED \| UNVERIFIABLE` with evidence, plus a one-line verdict — never empty |
| `explorer` | codebase | `.devforge/` internals | `_codebase_map.md` | ≤1 page: key files · patterns · data flow · risks |
| `architect` | `_user_request.md`, `1-triage.md`, `_request_fact_check.md`, `_codebase_map.md` if present, codebase; on a revision pass also its previous `2-design.md` + `_design_feedback.md` | `3-success-criteria.md` | `2-design.md` | the design template in step 3 |
| `success_criteria` | pasted content of the "What we're solving" and "How it will work" sections of `2-design.md`, plus `_user_request.md` and `1-triage.md` — nothing else | the rest of `2-design.md` (the solution), `claim.md` | `3-success-criteria.md` | numbered, testable criteria — each verifiable by a command or an observable behavior; no solution details |
| `implementer` | `2-design.md`, `3-success-criteria.md`, `_request_fact_check.md`, `_codebase_map.md` if present, all prior `iter-*/review-*.md` + `final-review-*.md` + `fulfillment.md` | — | source edits + `iter-N/claim.md` | what done · every finding fixed or skipped with a specific reason · for a behavior change, add a regression test — ideally shown red before the fix and green after, with the red→green noted in `claim.md` — never weaken/delete tests |
| `reviewer` | pasted content of `2-design.md`, `3-success-criteria.md`, `iter-N/diff.patch`, `iter-N/test-results.txt` — nothing else | `claim.md`, peer reviewers' output | `iter-N/review-<use>.md` | first line `VERDICT: PASS\|FAIL` (PASS = zero findings), then findings tagged `blocker\|major\|minor\|nit`. Two always-on checks regardless of what the design emphasizes: committed code must not reference run-internal artifacts (`.devforge/`, plan files, session paths); and cruft preserved by a faithful migration is still a finding — "byte-identical" instructions cover assertions/behavior, not carried-over dead code |
| `final_reviewer` | same as reviewer, plus the working tree | `claim.md`, peer reviewers' output | `iter-N/final-review-<use>.md` | same verdict format as reviewer |
| `fulfillment` | pasted content of `3-success-criteria.md`, `iter-N/diff.patch`, `iter-N/test-results.txt`, `iter-N/claim.md`, plus the working tree (may run the non-mutating check a criterion names) | `2-design.md` solution details, review files | `iter-N/fulfillment.md` | first line `VERDICT: PASS\|FAIL`, then each criterion `MET \| NOT MET` with evidence |

### Model tiering

`"auto"` (the shipped default) lets the orchestrator pick a model per role and triage tier; an
explicit name (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) is used verbatim. Resolve `"auto"` as: `implementer` →
`haiku` (`sonnet` for `medium`/`large` — a subtle change is not transcription); `verify`,
`explorer`, `success_criteria`, `reviewer` → `sonnet`; `architect` → `opus`; `final_reviewer` →
`opus` (`sonnet` for `trivial`/`small`). `sonnet` is the floor for review — never `haiku`. Resolve
every `"auto"` once at the design gate (step 4) so the human sees and can edit the picks; record
them in `_panel.json` and dispatch from there.

## Procedure

### 1. Triage

Orchestrator-owned cheap product screen — no dispatch, no deep code reading; a quick skim is
fine. Write `.devforge/1-triage.md` in about 12 lines:
- Problem
- Decision: `PROCEED | DEFER | DECLINE`
- Complexity: `trivial | small | medium | large`
- Review-only: `yes | no` — `yes` when the task is "review PR/branch/diff X" with nothing to build
- Approach sketch, high level only
- Open questions

Complexity rubric:

| Tier | Default panel |
|------|---------------|
| `trivial` | <=10 lines, 1 file, no control-flow/design change (a one-expression fix with an existing failing test qualifies): 1 reviewer, no final reviewers, `inner_iterations=1`, `final_review_rounds=0` |
| `small` | localized 1-3 file change: 1 reviewer, 1 final reviewer, `inner_iterations=2`, `final_review_rounds=1` |
| `medium` | feature or shared-helper change: 1 reviewer, 2 final reviewers, `inner_iterations=3`, `final_review_rounds=2` |
| `large` | 300+ lines, many files, core/foundational/public contract change: full roster, `inner_iterations=3`, `final_review_rounds=2` |

Blast-radius override: core/shared code or public API/response-contract changes are at least
`medium`, even if tiny.

**Triage has no gate.** Present the overview in chat and continue. Only when the decision is
`DEFER or DECLINE`, stop and recommend against proceeding, but let the human decide. Persist
`state.review_only=true|false` from the "Review-only:" line, then set `state.phase="verify"`.

### 2. Verify

Run the `verify` stage on every run — never skipped by tier. It builds the authoritative claim
ledger in `_request_fact_check.md`: every claim in the request tagged
`VALID | STALE | LIKELY-FIXED | UNVERIFIABLE` with evidence (running an existing test to verify
a claim is fine — remove artifacts it leaves). **For a review-only run the claim source is the
PR/branch description** (fetch it, e.g. `gh pr view`): tag each thing the PR says it does against
its actual diff and the codebase — this is the "does the PR do what it claims" lens no reviewer
covers, since reviewers stay blind to the PR narrative. If core claims are stale or already fixed,
present its verdict and stop with a recommendation; the human decides. Otherwise set
`state.phase="design"`.

### 3. Design: subagents draft, then iterate with the human

**Draft.**
- For `medium`/`large` complexity, first dispatch the `explorer` role (the
  `devforge-code-explorer` agent when available) to write `_codebase_map.md`; the architect and
  the implementer reuse it. For `trivial`/`small`, skip it.
- Dispatch the `architect` stage to write `.devforge/2-design.md`. ~1 page, no code blocks, no
  file:line dumps. Product first, implementation second:

  ```
  ## What we're solving      (product: the problem and who hits it)
  ## How it will work        (product: user-visible behavior after the change)
  ## Proposed solution       (implementation approach)
  ## Alternatives + the call
  ## Major changes           (key files/areas only — never an exhaustive file list)
  ## Risks
  ## Open questions          (numbered; each with your recommended answer)
  ## Decisions               (starts empty; filled from _design_feedback.md on revision)
  ```

  For a review-only run, `2-design.md` is the review scope: what to check and which reviewers.
- Dispatch the `success_criteria` stage: paste it ONLY the two product sections of the design
  (plus request and triage) and have it write `.devforge/3-success-criteria.md`. It defines
  "done" independently — the architect never reads it, and it never sees the solution.

**Iterate — the conversation is the orchestrator's; every rewrite is a subagent's.**
- Present the FULL `2-design.md` + `3-success-criteria.md` (see "Keep the human in the loop"),
  then work the open questions with the human: one question at a time, multiple choice where
  possible, always with your recommended answer. Settle the product questions first — what it
  does, how it behaves for the user, scope — and only then the implementation questions.
- Be proactive: raise risks and trade-off calls yourself; don't wait to be asked. YAGNI — cut
  speculative scope.
- **Batch a round of answers**, then append the human's answers verbatim to
  `_design_feedback.md` (append-only; the orchestrator writes only this file, never the design
  or the criteria).
- Re-run the `architect` as a **revision pass** — it reads its previous `2-design.md` +
  `_design_feedback.md` and revises; it does not re-explore. Re-run `success_criteria` only
  when the product sections changed.
- For `trivial` complexity, don't interrogate: present the drafts and ask for objections.
- Done when **Open questions is empty and the human says they're happy**. Then go to step 4.

### 4. Design gate

Do not edit source files until `.devforge/_design.approved` exists. Set
`state.phase="design-gate"`.

Propose the per-run review panel from the configured roster: start from the triage tier, adjust
for the actual design scope, and pick from the roster in config order unless the design's risk
calls for a specific reviewer. **Resolve every `"auto"` model to a concrete name** (see Model
tiering) at the settled tier — inline on each reviewer, and in a `models` map for the single
stages (only those whose config model is `"auto"`; an explicit model keeps its name). Write
`.devforge/_panel.json`:

```json
{
  "tier": "small",
  "reason": "localized low-risk change",
  "models": { "verify": "sonnet", "architect": "opus", "implementer": "haiku", "success_criteria": "sonnet", "fulfillment": "sonnet" },
  "reviewers": [{ "use": "staff-review", "model": "sonnet" }],
  "final_reviewers": [{ "use": "code-review", "model": "sonnet" }],
  "inner_iterations": 2,
  "final_review_rounds": 1
}
```

The approved panel must be a subset of the configured roster.

Surface the FULL `2-design.md` + `3-success-criteria.md` + `_panel.json` to the human, then
**stop for the human's decision.** Approval covers all three. Show the resolved per-stage models
in the panel summary so the human can bump any up or down before approving (a model change is a
Revise, folded into this gate — not a new stop). Two human-driven outcomes, recorded on disk:

**Approve.** A clear "yes/approve" in chat, or the human running `/devforge-approve-design`. Copy
the panel into `state.panel`, set `state.phase` to `"inner-loop"` (or `"review-run"` when
`state.review_only` is true) and `state.iteration` to `1`, and write `_design.approved` (the
approval skill does exactly this).

**Revise.** If the human asks for any change, do NOT write `_design.approved`: go back to the
step 3 iterate loop (feedback file + revision passes), re-present, and wait. Revise as many
rounds as the human wants; the gate clears only on approval.

**Plan mode (any agent that has one — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex…; optional).** With
`plan_mode_gate=true` and plan-mode tools available (`EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode` on Claude Code),
mirror the FULL `2-design.md` + `3-success-criteria.md` + `_panel.json` into the plan body (not a
summary) as an adapter over the two outcomes: accepting it IS Approve; rejecting or editing it IS
Revise. On a plan-tool error or unavailability, fall back to chat (paste everything there).

**Never self-approve.** Never infer approval from a plan-tool error, a plan-mode transition, or a
"continue" message — approval is a human "yes", accepting the plan, or the approval skill. The
on-disk `_design.approved` is the only approval signal; resume only once it exists. For a review-only
run, the same gate approves the review scope; on approval go to step 8 instead of the inner loop.

### 5. Inner loop

Use `state.panel`, not the raw roster; validate it against config. If absent (older run), fall
back to the full roster and limits and record that in `_progress.md`.

For each iteration `N`:
1. Set `state.phase="inner-loop"` and `state.iteration=N`; create `.devforge/iter-N/`.
2. Before the first source edit, run `git status --porcelain` (ignore `.devforge/` entries); stop
   if pre-existing unrelated changes are present. Then run the `implementer` stage: it applies
   `2-design.md` + `3-success-criteria.md`, addresses every prior finding, and writes
   `iter-N/claim.md`.
3. Run `oracle.commands`; if empty, record and run the smallest credible inferred fallback. Use
   finite, deterministic, non-mutating commands; avoid `dev`, `start`, `watch`, `lint:fix`,
   `format`, `clean`, inspectors, and eval workflows. If no credible command exists, the oracle
   is not green.
4. Check `git status --porcelain` again (ignore `.devforge/`). If unrelated changes appeared,
   stop for human direction. Write `diff.patch` only for approved-run changes.
5. Dispatch panel reviewers in parallel, each given the pasted content of `2-design.md`,
   `3-success-criteria.md`, `diff.patch`, and `test-results.txt` — nothing else. They stay blind
   to `claim.md` and peer reviews.
6. Converge when the oracle is green, no `blocker` or `major` finding is open, and every
   `minor`/`nit` is fixed or recorded as skipped with a specific reason in `claim.md`. Otherwise
   iterate until `inner_iterations`; then stop and present a findings table
   (fixed / open / skipped), the oracle status, and the options: extend the limit, accept with
   skips recorded, or abandon.

When converged, set `state.phase="final-review"` if the panel has final reviewers; otherwise set
`state.phase="create-pr"`.

### 6. Final review

Run panel `final_reviewers` in parallel (same pasted-content rule, plus working-tree access).
Open `blocker`/`major` findings trigger a targeted implementer fix and a re-run of the final
reviewers (and the regular reviewers too when the fix is broad), staying in
`phase="final-review"`, bounded by `final_review_rounds`. When clean by the step 5 convergence
rule, set `state.phase="create-pr"`.

### 7. Fulfillment + create-PR confirm

On entering `phase="create-pr"`, dispatch the `fulfillment` stage: it judges the diff, tests,
and claim against `3-success-criteria.md` and writes `iter-N/fulfillment.md` with each criterion
`MET | NOT MET`.

- Any `NOT MET` criterion reopens the inner loop like a blocker finding, within the same limits.
  When limits are exhausted, or the human disputes a criterion itself, ask the human: accept
  with the exception recorded, extend the limit, or abandon.
- When fulfillment passes: no plan mode. Summarize in chat — the fulfillment table, oracle
  status, reviewer verdicts, fixed findings, **every skipped finding with its reason**,
  `git diff --stat`. Ask **"commit & open PR?"** and proceed only on a clear yes, which records
  `_create_pr.approved`. Headless runs use `/devforge-approve-create-pr`. This approves creating
  the PR, not merging it.

### 8. Review mode (review-only runs)

After the design gate approves the review scope, build `iter-1/diff.patch` from the branch
under review (`git diff <base>...HEAD`), set `state.phase="review-run"`, and run the panel
reviewers and final reviewers against it. Present a findings summary in chat. **do NOT implement
and do NOT merge.** If the human then asks to fix findings, continue at the next free `iter-N`
with `state.phase="inner-loop"` and run the normal loop from step 5.

### 9. Finish

1. Re-check `git status --porcelain` (ignore `.devforge/`); stop if unrelated changes are present.
2. Commit, then write the commit message and PR body in plain language — **What we're solving ·
   How · Alternatives considered** — and nothing else. Never enumerate code changes that are
   obvious from the diff. Summarize run evidence in the PR body (fulfillment result, oracle
   result, reviewer verdicts, skipped findings); the run files themselves stay ignored.
3. If a writable remote exists, push and open a PR. Record the evidence summary, approval
   timestamps, and PR URL in `_progress.md`, then set `state.phase="done"`.

## Hard rules

- Only write inside `.devforge/` until `_design.approved` exists.
- The orchestrator routes; it never writes a judgment file. Human feedback goes verbatim into
  `_design_feedback.md`; subagents rewrite `2-design.md` / `3-success-criteria.md` /
  `_request_fact_check.md` — never the orchestrator.
- Never self-approve a gate. Write `_design.approved` / `_create_pr.approved` only on an explicit
  human approval for that gate — a human accepting the plan dialog, a clear chat "yes", or the
  approval skill. A rejected/edited plan, a plan-tool error or closed stream, or a "continue from
  where you left off" message is NEVER approval — those mean revise or keep waiting; the on-disk
  marker is the only approval signal.
- Triage has no gate; iterate the design with the human before the gate — chat is never the record.
- Verify runs on every run; the claim ledger is never empty.
- Blindness: architect never reads the success criteria; the criteria author never sees the
  solution; reviewers and fulfillment get pasted content only — never file access, never
  `claim.md`, never peer reviews.
- Never commit `.devforge/` files. It's repo-gitignored; the run's own `.devforge/.gitignore`
  exceptions (`config.json`, `registry.json`) are local-only, not an invitation to `git add -f`
  or commit them.
- Keep design short and high-level: major changes only, never an exhaustive file list.
- Surface human-facing artifacts into the human's channel; on-disk files and slash-commands are
  never the only door.
- The panel, not the roster, drives the run; never run a `use` not in config.
- Trust the oracle, not model self-reports. Never weaken/delete tests.
- Converge on severity: no open `blocker`/`major`; every `minor`/`nit` fixed or skipped with a
  specific reason, and every skip shown at the create-PR confirm.
- A finding fixable only by changing the approved `2-design.md` / `3-success-criteria.md` is the
  human's call — surface it at the gate; never edit an approved artifact to silence a finding.
- No PR without fulfillment: every criterion `MET`, or the human explicitly accepts the
  exception.
- Commit/PR text is plain: what we're solving, how, alternatives — no obvious-from-the-diff narration.
